This is an angular based project to view the points table, live scores etc of English Premier League.
Currently the data is served from the JSON file. 
We can also  serve the data from api but need to replace the url in the team.service.ts file.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.5.
